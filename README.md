## Flipkart Big Billion Days Sale Analysis

This project presents an analysis of the Flipkart Big Billion Days Sale, focusing specifically on smartphones, using Python. The analysis includes:

- Importing and preprocessing of a dataset obtained from Kaggle containing information about products offered during the sale.
- Calculation of discounts offered on smartphones.
- Identification of top deals based on highest discounts, highest ratings, and most expensive offers.
- Visualization of key insights using Plotly library.
- Calculation of the cost of discounts to Flipkart for smartphones.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the sale, showcasing top deals, highest-rated products, and cost implications for Flipkart. The Python code and dataset used are included for further exploration and analysis.


For loading the dataset into Snowflake for future analysis because Snowflake is a Powerful tool for Data Analysis, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a Snowflake account and set up a database and schema.
2. Use Snowflake's data loading tools (such as SnowSQL or Snowpipe) to load the dataset into Snowflake. You may need to convert the dataset to a compatible format like CSV or Parquet if it's not already in one.
3. Once the dataset is loaded into Snowflake, you can perform various SQL queries and analyses on it to derive further insights.
